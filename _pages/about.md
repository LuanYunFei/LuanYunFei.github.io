I am a Ph.D. Student from the [Institute of Medical Robotics](https://imr.sjtu.edu.cn/), [School of Biomedical Engineering](https://en.bme.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes surgical robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. 

I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Guang-Zhong Yang](https://imr.sjtu.edu.cn/xy_leaders/2886.html) and [Associate Prof. Yao Guo](https://imr.sjtu.edu.cn/sz_teachers/3452.html). You can explore our labâ€™s latest projects and contributions on [github@IMR-PCB](https://github.com/IMR-PCB) and [youtube@IMR-PCB](https://www.youtube.com/@IMR-PCB)!
